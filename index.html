        <h1>Favorite artists!</h1>
        <p><strong>Linkin Park</strong> has always been a band that mixes rock, rap, and electronic sounds in a way that's just unforgettable. Their music has been the soundtrack to so many of my favorite moments, and I still get chills listening to their hits like <strong>“In the End”</strong> and <strong>“Numb”</strong> . Also their new album called <strong>"From Zero"</strong>. I would absolutely love to see them live this summer. Can you imagine the energy at their concert? Fingers crossed they will be back on tour soon!</p>
